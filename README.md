# AnalyzingStockData
This project is part of my udemy course [Python for data science and machine learning bootcamp](https://bit.ly/2psRJXw) from Jose Portilla. Project is more focused on exploratory data analysis of stock prices. This project is just meant to practice visualization and pandas skills.

> We'll focus on bank stocks and see how they progressed throughout the [financial crisis](https://bit.ly/1HcGZQr) all the way to early 2016.
